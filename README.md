Here I have conducted a research on 220 Band AVIRIS Hyperspectral Image of Indian Pine Test Site 3. The purpose of this reserach was classification of Hyperspectral image (Indian Pine test site). 

Firstly , I did a thoroughout study on the working principle of remote sensing that includes from collecting image by the sensor to Analyzing the image. The first folder contains a pdf named "Remote Sensing Working Principle" contains indepth report on the whole process of remote sensing.

Secondly , I studied different kinds of machine algorithms fromt the scratch with mathmatical details and then applied this algorithm on our desired datatset.

Thridly , one of the major issues working with hyperspectral image is it's huge number of dimension that slows down the computational process. So I went through different feature extraction methods to reduce the curse of dimensionality.

Finally , even after solving curse of dimensionality , another problem came up and that's class imbalance issue due to insufficient number of samples. This has been resolved by modifield SMOTE technique where ratio of each class in main dataset has been maintained.
